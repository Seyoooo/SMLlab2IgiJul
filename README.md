A lab exercise to build a Machine Learning system for speech transcription in Polish. 
## 1. System components
The [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sanchit-gandhi/notebooks/blob/main/fine_tune_whisper.ipynb) used as a baseline has in the first phase been split into feature and training pipelines. 
### 1.1 Feature pipeline
### 1.2 Training pipeline
### 1.3 User interface 
The UI has been created in the form of an [app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PiJul/PolishCarelessWhisper) on HuggingFace. 

There are a few tabs allowing the user to transcribe speech recorded from their microphone, as well as paste a link to a video on YouTube 

We also added the option to simply search a phrase on YouTube and choose how many seconds should be transcribed. 

## 2. Possible improvements
